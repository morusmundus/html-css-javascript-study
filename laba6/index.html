            <p class="p1">Virtue theory reflects the ancient assumption that humans have a fixed nature – an essence – and that the way we flourish is by adhering to that nature. Aristotle described this in terms of what he called proper functioning. Everything has a function, and a thing is good to the extent that it fulfills its function, and bad to the extent that it doesn’t. </p><br>

            <p class="p2">This is easy to see in objects created by humans. A function of a knife is to cut; so, a dull knife is a bad knife. And a function of a flower is to grow and reproduce; so, a flower that doesn’t grow is just bad at being a flower. And, the same goes for humans – we’re animals – so all the stuff that would indicate proper functioning for an animal holds true for us as well – we need to grow and be healthy and fertile. </p><br>

            <p class="p3">But, we’re also “the rational animal,” and a social animal, so our function also involves using reason and getting along with our pack.</p><br>

            <p class="p4">Aristotle argued that nature has built into us the desire to be virtuous, in the same way that acorns are built with the drive to become oak trees. But what exactly does it mean to be virtuous? Aristotle said that having virtue just means doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right way, in the right amount, toward the right people. </p><br> 

            <p class="p5">Which sort of sounds like Aristotle is saying exactly nothing. I mean, how vague can you be? But according to Aristotle, there's no need to be specific, because if you’re virtuous, you know what to do. All the time. You know how to handle yourself and how to get along with others. You have good judgment, you can read a room, and you know what's right and when. </p><br>

            <p class="p6">Aristotle understood virtue as a set of robust character traits that, once developed, will lead to predictably good behavior. You can think of virtue as the midpoint between two extremes, which Aristotle called vices. Virtue is the just the right amount, the sweet spot between the extreme of excess and the extreme of deficiency. And this sweet spot is known as the Golden Mean. </p>

        Bada (stylized as bada; Korean: 바다) is a discontinued mobile operating system developed by Samsung Electronics for devices such as mid- to high-end smartphones and tablet computers. The name is derived from "바다 (bada)", meaning "ocean" or "sea" in Korean. All phones running Bada were branded with the name Wave, unlike Samsung's Android devices which are branded as Galaxy.<br>

        To foster adoption of Bada, Samsung reportedly considered releasing the source code under an open-source license, and expanding device support to include Smart TVs.[3] In June 2012 Samsung announced its intention to merge Bada into the Tizen project, while still using it in parallel with Google's Android OS and Microsoft's Windows Phone on its smartphones.<br>
        On 25 February 2013, Samsung announced that it would stop developing Bada, moving development to Tizen instead. Bug reporting was terminated in April 2014.
